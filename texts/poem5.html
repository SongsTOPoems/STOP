      <p>
        I could not run or play in <span class="family">boyhood</span>.<br>
        In <span class="family">manhood</span> I could only sip the cup,<br>
        Not drink-<br>
        For <span class="sickness">scarlet-fever</span> left my <span class="sickness">heart diseased</span>.<br>
        Yet I lie here<br>
        Soothed by a secret none but Mary knows:<br>
        There is a <span class="nature">garden</span> of acacia,<br>
        Catalpa trees, and arbors sweet with vines--<br>
        There on that afternoon in June<br>
        By Mary's side--<br>
        Kissing her with my <span class="salvation">soul</span> upon my lips<br>
        It suddenly took flight.<br>
