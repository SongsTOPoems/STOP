        In a whirlpool of <span class="nature">dust</span><br>
        the others saw <span class="nature">drought</span><br>
        it reminded me<br>
        of Jennyâ€™s skirt<br>
        in a dance many years ago.<br><br>

        I felt my earth<br>
        <span class="dancing">vibrate with sounds</span>, it was my <span class="salvation">heart</span>,<br>
        and so why till it again<br>
        how to think it better.<br><br>

        Liberty I have seen it sleeping<br>
        in the tilled fields<br>
        from <span class="salvation">heaven</span> and money,<br>
        from <span class="salvation">heaven</span> and love,<br>
        protected by barbed wire.<br><br>

        Liberty I have seen it wake up<br>
        every time I have <span class="music">played</span><br>
        for a <span class="nature">rustle</span> of girls<br>
        at a dance<br>
        for a drunk companion.<br><br>

        And then if people know<br>
        and people know you can <span class="music">play</span>,<br>
        <span class="music">playing</span> is up to you<br>
        all <span class="salvation">life</span> long<br>
        and you like being <span class="music">listened</span> to.<br><br>
        
        It ended up with fields of weeds<br>
        it ended up with a broken <span class="music">flute</span><br>
        and many memories<br>
        and a raucous laughter<br>
        and not even one regret.<br>
