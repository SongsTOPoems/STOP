      <h3 class="bolder">A Blasphemer</h3>
      <h4 class="subtitle">(Behind every blasphemer there's an enchanted garden)</h4>
      <p>
        I never again bent down, not even over a <span class="nature">flower</span>.<br>
        I blushed no more in stealing love<br>
        from the moment Winter convinced me that <span class="church">God</span><br>
        would not be blushed stealing mine from me.<br><br>

        They arrested me one day for the women and the wine.<br>
        They didn’t have <span class="justice">laws</span> to <span class="hate">punish</span> a <span class="relgion">blasphemer</span>.<br>
        <span class="death">Death</span> didn’t kill me, but two holier-than-thou guards<br>
        searched my <span class="salvation">soul</span> with the force of blows.<br><br>

        Because I said that <span class="church">God</span> deceived the first man.<br>
        He forced him to travel <span class="salvation">life</span> as a <span class="suffering">fool</span>.<br>
        In the <span class="nature">enchanted garden</span> He forced him to dream,<br>
        "to ignore that there's both good and <span class="damantion">evil</span> in the world."<br><br>

        When He saw that the man stretched his fingers<br>
        to steal the mystery of a prohibited apple,<br>
        fearing that by then he had no masters<br>
        He stopped him with <span class="death">death</span>, He invented the seasons.<br><br>

        They searched my <span class="salvation">soul</span> with the force of blows<br><br>
        
        And if there were two guards to stop my <span class="salvation">life</span>,<br>
        it is only here on earth the prohibited apple.<br>
        And not <span class="church">God</span>, but someone who invented it for us.<br>
        forces us to dream in an <span class="nature">enchanted garden</span>,<br>
        forces us to dream in an <span class="nature">enchanted garden</span>,<br>
        forces us to dream in an <span class="nature">enchanted garden</span>.
