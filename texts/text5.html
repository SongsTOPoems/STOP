      <p>
        “I too began dreaming along with them,<br>
        then suddenly my <span class="salvation">soul</span> took flight.”<br><br>
        
        "You're a boy spying the kids playing," <br>
        at the senseless <span class="music">rhythm</span> of your sick <span class="salvation">heart</span>,<br>
        and you get the urge to go out and try -<br>
        what do you lack for running in the <span class="nature">meadow</span>? -<br>
        and you hold the urge, and you stay put to think,<br>
        "How the devil do they recover their <span class="sickness">breath</span>?"<br><br>

        "You're a man sensing the time wasted" <br>
        on making your <span class="sight">eyes</span> <span class="secret">narrate</span> <span class="salvation">life</span> to you,<br>
        and never being able to drink a cup in one gulp,<br>
        but in little interrupted sips;<br>
        and never being able to drink a cup in one gulp,<br>
        but in little interrupted sips.<br><br>

        And yet a smile I did give,<br>
        and it still returns in every one of her summers<br>
        when I guided her, or maybe I was guided,<br>
        to count her hairs with sweaty hands.<br><br>

        I don’t believe I asked her gaze for promises,<br>
        it doesn’t seem to me that I chose silence or voice<br>
        when the <span class="salvation">heart</span> stunned, and now, no, I don’t recall<br>
        if it was too dismayed or too happy,<br>
        and my <span class="salvation">heart</span> went crazy, and now, no, I don’t recall<br>
        from which horizon the light faded away.<br><br>

        And amidst the sweet entertainment on the grass,<br>
        between long <span class="love">caresses</span> concluded on the face,<br>
        those mother-of-pearl colored thighs of hers<br>
        remained, perhaps an unpicked <span class="nature">flower</span>.<br><br>

        But that I kissed her, this, yes, I remember,<br>
        with my <span class="salvation">heart</span> by then on her lips.<br>
        But that I kissed her, by <span class="church">God</span>, yes I remember.<br>
        and my <span class="salvation">heart</span> stayed on her lips.<br><br>

        “And the <span class="salvation">soul</span> suddenly took flight,<br>
        but I don’t <span class="love">feel</span> like dreaming with them.<br>
        No, one can’t manage to dream with them.”
