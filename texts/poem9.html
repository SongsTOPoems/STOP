      <p>       
            The earth keeps some vibration going
<br>        There in your <span class="salvation">heart, and that is you.
<br>        And if the people find you can <span class="music">fiddle</span>,
<br>        Why, <span class="music">fiddle</span> you must, for all your life.
<br>        What do you see, a harvest of clover?
<br>        Or a <span class="nature">meadow</span> to walk through to the river?
<br>        The wind's in the corn; you rub your hands
<br>        For beeves here after ready for market;
<br>        Or else you hear the <span class="nature">rustle</span> of skirts
<br>        Like the girls when dancing at Little Grove.
<br>        To Cooney Potter a pillar of <span class="nature">dust</span>
<br>        Or <span class="music">whirling</span> leaves meant ruinous drouth;
<br>        They looked to me like Red-Head Sammy
<br>        Stepping it off, to "Toor-a-Loor."
<br>        How could I till my forty <span class="nature">acres</span>
<br>        Not to speak of getting more,
<br>        With a medley of horns, <span class="music">bassoons</span> and piccolos
<br>        Stirred in my brain by crows and robins
<br>        And the creak of a wind-mill--only these?
<br>        And I never started to plow in my <span class="salvation">life</span>
<br>        That some one did not stop in the road
<br>        And take me away to a dance or picnic.
<br>        I ended up with forty <span class="nature">acres</span>;
<br>        I ended up with a broken <span class="music">fiddle</span>--
<br>        And a broken laugh, and a thousand memories,
<br>        And not a single regret.
