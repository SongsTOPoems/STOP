      <p>
        You try to have a world in your <span class="salvation">heart</span><br>
        and can’t manage to express it with words,<br>
        and the <span class="darkness vs lights">light</span> of day separates the plaza<br>
        into a laughing <span class="nature">village</span> and you, the fool, who passes.<br>
        And not even the night leaves you alone:<br>
        the others dream of themselves and you dream of them.<br><br>

        And yes, even you would go to search<br>
        for the words certain to make them listen to you:<br>
        to amaze for a half hour, a book of history is enough.<br>
        I tried to learn the Encyclopedia Treccani by <span class="salvation">heart</span>,<br>
        and after 'pig,' 'Majakowsky,' 'messy,'<br>
        the others continued on until they read me 'crazy.'<br>
        And without knowing to whom I owed my <span class="salvation">life</span>,<br>
        to a madhouse I returned it:<br>
        here on the <span class="nature">hill</span> I sleep unwillingly.<br>
        yet by now there is <span class="darkness vs lights">light</span> in my thoughts.<br>
        Here in the semi-<span class="darkness vs lights">darkness</span>, now I invent words,<br>
        though I miss a <span class="darkness vs lights">light</span>, the <span class="darkness vs lights">light</span> of the sun.<br><br>

        My bones are still giving to <span class="salvation">life</span>:<br>
        they’re still giving it flowery grass.<br>
        But <span class="salvation">life</span> remained in the voices on the sly<br>
        of those who lost the fool and mourn for him in the <span class="nature">hill</span>,<br>
        of those who still whisper with the same irony,<br>
        “A merciful <span class="death">death</span> tore him out of craziness.”<br>
