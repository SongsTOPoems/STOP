        I said when they handed me my <span class="writing">diploma</span>,<br>
        I said to myself I will be good<br>
        And wise and brave and helpful to others;<br>
        I said I will carry the <span class="church">Christian</span> creed<br>
        Into the practice of <span class="writing">medicine</span>!<br>
        Somehow the world and the other <span class="sickness">doctors</span><br>
        Know what's in your <span class="salvation">heart</span> as soon as you make<br>
        This high-souled resolution.<br>
        And the way of it is they starve you out.<br>
        And no one comes to you but the poor.<br>
        And you find too late that being a <span class="sickness">doctor</span><br>
        Is just a way of making a living.<br>
        And when you are poor and have to carry<br>
        The <span class="church">Christian</span> creed and <span class="family">wife</span> and <span class="family">children</span><br>
        All on your back, it is too much.<br>
        That's why I made the Elixir of <span class="family">Youth</span>,<br>
        Which landed me in the jail at Peoria,<br>
        Branded a <span class="damnation">swindler</span> and a crook<br>
        By the upright federal <span class="justice">judge</span>!<br>
