      <h3 class="bolder">A doctor</h3>
      <p>
        As a child I wanted to heal <span class="nature">cherry</span> trees<br>
        when, red with fruit, I believed them injured.<br>
        For me, <span class="sickness">health</span> had left them<br>
        with the snowy <span class="nature">flowers</span> they’d lost.<br><br>

        A dream, it was a dream, but it wasn't short-lived.<br>
        For this I swore that I would become a <span class="writing">doctor</span>,<br>
        and not for a <span class="church">god</span>, nor either for play:<br>
        so that the <span class="nature">cherry</span> trees would return in bloom,<br>
        so that the <span class="nature">cherry</span> trees would return in bloom.<br><br>

        And when I was a <span class="writing">doctor</span> finally,<br>
        I didn’t want to betray the <span class="family">child</span> for the man,<br>
        and so many came and they called themselves “people,<br>
        sick <span class="nature">cherry</span> trees in every season.<br><br>

        And my colleagues in agreement, contented colleagues,<br>
        reading in my <span class="salvation">heart</span> so much desire to love,<br>
        sent me their best clients,<br>
        with the <span class="sickness">diagnosis</span> on their faces -<br>
        and for everyone it was the same:<br>
        sick with hunger, unable to pay.<br><br>

        And then I realized I had to understand<br>
        that being a <span class="writing">doctor</span> is just a job,<br>
        that you can’t give the science to people<br>
        if you don’t want to fall sick with the identical ailment,<br>
        if you don’t want the system to starve you into submission.<br><br>

        And the reliable system is to starve you into submission,<br>
        in your <span class="family">children</span>, in your <span class="family">wife</span>, who now despise you.<br>
        Therefore I sealed in a bottle those snowy <span class="nature">flowers</span>.<br>
        The label said: elixir of <span class="family">youth</span>.<br><br>

        And a <span class="justice">judge</span>, a <span class="justice">judge</span> with the face of a man,<br>
        sent me off to leaf through sunsets in prison,<br>
        useless to the world and to my fingers,<br>
        branded forever a <span class="damnation">swindler</span>, a crook,<br>
        <span class="writing">doctor</span>, professor, <span class="damnation">swindler</span>, crook.
