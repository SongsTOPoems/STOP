        What do you see now?<br>
        <span class="religion">Globes</span> of red, yellow, purple.<br>
        Just a moment! And now?<br>
        My father and mother and sisters.<br>
        Yes! And now?<br>
        Knights at arms, beautiful women, kind faces.<br>
        Try this.<br>
        A field of grain -- a city.<br>
        Very good! And Now?<br>
        A young woman with <span class="nature">angels bending</span> over her.<br>
        A heavier <span class="sight">lens</span>! And Now?<br>
        Many women with bright <span class="sight">eyes</span> and open lips.<br>
        Try this.<br>
        Just a goblet on a table.<br>
        Oh I see! Try this <span class="sight">lens</span>!<br>
        Just an open <span class="religion">space</span> -- I see nothing in particular.<br>
        Well, now!<br>
        Pine trees, a lake, summer sky.<br>
        That's better. And now?<br>
        A <span class="writing">book</span>.<br>
        Read a page for me.<br>
        I can't. My <span class="sight">eyes</span> are carried beyond the page.<br>
        Try this <span class="sight">lens</span>.<br>
        <span class="nature">Depths of air</span>.<br>
        Excellent! and now?<br>
        <span class="sight">Light</span>, just <span class="sight">light</span>, making everything below a toy world.<br>
        Very well, we'll make the <span class="sight">glasses</span> accordingly.<br>
