        They first charged me with disorderly conduct,<br>
        There being no statute on <span class="damnation">blasphemy</span>.<br>
        Later they locked me up as insane<br>
        Where I was beaten to <span class="death">death</span> by a <span class="church">Catholic</span> guard.<br>
        My offense was this:<br>
        I said <span class="church">God</span> lied to <span class="church">Adam</span>, and destined him<br>
        To lead the <span class="salvation">life</span> of a <span class="suffering">fool</span>,<br>
        Ignorant that there is <span class="damnation">evil</span> in the world as well as good.<br>
        And when <span class="church">Adam</span> outwitted <span class="church">God</span> by eating the apple<br>
        And saw through the lie,<br>
        <span class="church">God</span> drove him out of <span class="religion">Eden</span> to keep him from taking<br>
        The fruit of immortal <span class="salvation">life</span>.<br>
        For <span class="church">Christ</span>’s sake, you sensible people,<br>
        Here’s what <span class="church">God</span> Himself said about it in the <span class="knowledge">book</span> of <span class="church">Genesis</span>:<br>
        “And the Lord <span class="church">God</span> said, behold the man<br>
        is become one of us” (a little envy, you see),<br>
        “To know good and <span class="damnation">evil</span>” (the all-is-good lie exposed)<br>
        “And now lest he put forth his hand and take<br>
        Also of the three of <span class="salvation">life</span> and eat, and live forever:<br>
        Therefore the Lord <span class="church">God</span> sent Him forth from the <span class="nature">garden</span> of <span class="religion">Eden</span><br>
        (The reason I believe <span class="church">God</span> <span class="church">crucified</span> His Own Son<br>
        To get out of the <span class="suffering">wretched</span> tangle is, because it sounds just like Him).<br>
