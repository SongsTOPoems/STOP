    "<p>The main goal of our project is to make a <b>comparison</b>, from a semantic point of view, between the <b>Fabrizio De André music album</b>, with the title <b>\"Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo\"</b>, and the <b>Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River anthology poems</b>.</p> \n",

    "During an interview made by Fernanda Pivano, who translated and reviewed together with Cesare Pavese the first italian edition of the Spoon River's anthology, Fabrizio De André said:<br>\n",
    "   <em>“Spoon River l’ho letto da ragazzo, avrò avuto 18 anni. Mi era piaciuto [...] forse perché in questi personaggi si trova qualcosa di me. Poi mi è capitato di rileggerlo, due anni fa [1969, ndr], e mi sono reso conto che non era invecchiato per niente. Soprattutto mi ha colpito un fatto: nella vita, si è costretti alla competizione, magari si è costretti a pensare il falso o a non essere sinceri, nella morte, invece, i personaggi di Spoon River si esprimono con estrema sincerità, perché non hanno più da aspettarsi niente, non hanno più niente da pensare. Così parlano come da vivi non sono mai stati capaci di fare”.</em>\n",
    "<p>Our main research questions are: <br>\n",
    "<b><em>\"Is it possible to extract in an automatic way the main themes treated in each of the nine Spoon River poems and in the De André corresponding songs?\"<br>\n",
    "\"What are the differences between them?\" <br> \"Are the results that we gather from this topic extraction in line with the personal interpretation of De André about his own music album?\"</em></b></p>"

Years pass, as do months, and, if you count them, so do minutes, it’s sad to find yourself an adult without having grown up; backbiting insists, it beats its tongue on a drum until it says that a dwarf is certainly a skunk because his heart is too close to his arsehole. It was in the sleepless nights watched over by the light of ill feeling that I studied for my exams, I became an attorney to take the road that from the pews of a cathedral led to the vestry then to the bench of a court, a judge at last, the arbiter on earth of good and bad. And so my height no longer bestowed good humour on he who, standing in the dock, called me “Your Honour”, and entrusting him to the executioner was entirely my pleasure, before genuflecting in the hour of farewell not knowing at all the height of God.\"\"\")"

My offense was this: I said God lied to Adam, and destined him to lead the life of a fool, Ignorant that there is evil in the world as well as good. And when Adam outwitted God by eating the apple And saw through the lie, God drove him out of Eden to keep him from taking The fruit of immortal life. For Christ's sake, you sensible people, Here's what God Himself says about it in the book of Genesis: \"And the Lord God said, behold the man Is become as one of us\" (a little envy, you see), \"To know good and evil\" (The all-is-good lie exposed): \"And now lest he put forth his hand and take Also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever: Therefore the Lord God sent Him forth from the Garden of Eden.\" The reason I believe God crucified His Own Son To get out of the wretched tangle is, because it sounds just like Him.''')"

And when at long last I was a doctor I didn’t want to betray the child for the man and many came, they were called people cherries that were ill in every season. And colleagues who agreed, the colleagues who were happy in reading in my heart my wish to love sent me their best clients with the diagnosis on their face and it was the same for everyone: ill from hunger, unable to pay. And then I understood, I was obliged to understand, that being a doctor is just a trade that science isn’t something you can give to people if you don’t want to go down with the same illness, if you don’t want the system to take you for hunger. And the system surely will take you for hunger in your children, in your wife who now despises you, and so those snow flowers are closed in a bottle, the label said: the elixir of youth. And a judge, a judge with the face of a man sent me to shed sunsets in prison useless to me and to my fingers branded forever a swindler and a cheat doctor professor swindler cheat.''')"

Only death took me up the hill. As a chemist one day I had the power to marry the elements and make them react, but I never managed to understand how men could combine through love, entrusting joy and pain to a game. Look at the smile, look at the colour how they play on the face of those who seek love: but the same smile, the same colour where are they on the face of those who’ve had love, where are they on the face of those who’ve had love. It’s strange to leave without suffering, without the face of a woman you have to remember. But maybe your dying is different you who leave yourselves to love who surrender to April. What is there that’s different in your dying. Spring doesn’t knock, it enters self-assured like smoke it penetrates every crack it has lips of meat, hair of corn such fear, such desire that it takes you by the hand. Such fear, such desire that it takes you far. But look at hydrogen keeping silent in the sea look at oxygen sleeping silently at his side: only a law that I can understand was able to marry them without making them explode only a law that I can understand. I was a chemist and, no, I didn’t want to marry. I didn’t know with whom and whom I would have generated. I died in an experiment that went wrong just like the idiots who die of love. And someone will say there’s a better way.''')"

No longer an optician, but a lens dealer for improvising happy eyes, because the pupils who are used to copying invent worlds on which they can watch. Follow with me these dreaming eyes, fleeing from the orbit and not wanting to return. “I see that I climb to steal the sun so as to have no more nights, I closed it in my eyes so as not to let it fall in nets of sunsets, and who will be cold will be cold along my glance they’ll need to warm up.” “I see the rivers inside my veins, they seek, they seek, they seek, they seek, they seek their sea, they break the banks, the banks, the banks, the banks, they fi nd skies, skies, skies, skies to photograph. Blood that runs without imagination brings tumours of melancholy.” “I see gendarmes graze women bent over the dew, red the tongues from the pollen of flowers but where’s the queen bee? Maybe she’s flown to dawn’s nests, maybe she’s flown, maybe she no longer flies.” “I see friends still on the road, they aren’t in a hurry, they still steal happiness from sleep and a bit of night from dawn, and then the light, light that transforms the world into a toy.” We’ll make glasses this way! We’ll make glasses this way!''')"

I felt my earth vibrate with sounds, it was my heart, and so why till it again how to think it better. Liberty I have seen it sleeping in the tilled fields from heaven and money, from heaven and love, protected by barbed wire. Liberty I have seen it wake up every time I have played for a rustle of girls at a dance for a drunk companion. And then if people know and people know you can play, playing is up to you all life long and you like being listened to. It ended up with fields of weeds it ended up with a broken flute and many memories and a raucous laughter and not even one regret.''')"

To Cooney Potter a pillar of dust Or whirling leaves meant ruinous drouth; They looked to me like Red-Head Sammy Stepping it off to 'Toor-a-Loor.' How could I till my forty acres Not to speak of getting more, With a medley of horns, bassoons and piccolos Stirred in my brain by crows and robins And the creak of a wind-mill--only these? And I never started to plow in my life That some one did not stop in the road And take me away to a dance or picnic.
