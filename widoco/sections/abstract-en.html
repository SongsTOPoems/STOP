<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
We created this ontology to actually allows us to express the differences between the concept album, "Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo", by Fabrizio de André and the anthology, "Spoon River Anthology", by E. G. Masters. In fact, Fabrizio de André was inspired by the poems in his writing and through our work we hope to actually confront these two mediums to find similarities and differences.</span>
